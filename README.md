What is Prometheus?
•	Prometheus is an open source monitoring tool
•	Provides out-of-the-box monitoring capabilities for the Kubernetes container orchestration platform. It can monitor servers and databases as well.
•	Collects and stores metrics as time-series data, recording information with a timestamp 
•	It is based on pull and collects metrics from targets by scraping metrics HTTP endpoints.
What is Grafana?
•	Grafana is an open source visualization and analytics software. 
•	It allows you to query, visualize, alert on, and explore your metrics no matter where they are stored.
Why System monitoring is critical?
•	Alerting: can give early warning of issues or problems before they become serious, costly or irreversible.
•	Visibility: Monitoring provides real-time insights into the health and performance of your applications and infrastructure.
•	Capacity Planning: By collecting and analyzing data over time, you can make informed decisions about capacity planning, such as when to add or remove nodes, allocate more resources, or scale your applications.
